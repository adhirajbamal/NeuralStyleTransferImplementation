Neural Style Transfer system using PyTorch


# Neural Style Transfer

An implementation of neural style transfer (NST) using PyTorch, based on the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Gatys et al.

## Features

- Transfer artistic styles from one image to another
- Uses VGG-19 pretrained network
- Adjustable style and content weights
- Interactive command-line interface
- Save or display results

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the style transfer application:
python style_transfer.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to:

Provide paths to content and style images

View the stylized result

Optionally save the output
